  <h1>On Task Work</h1>
  <br>
  <h>This Work Is On Task</h><br><br>
  <p>This work is 100% FDA guaranteed on-task, whole grain and organic. It meets all prerequisites of being on-task, and measures up to the highest standards of on-taskness. In fact, my work is so on-task that if you were to compare it to the other 99.99th percentile of work, you would find my work more on-task by orders of magnitude. One mole of other work does not compare to a single page of my work, which is so on-task that even the worst students have trouble being off task with this work. Of course, there are those who claim that my work is not on-task and is in fact off-task. Such terrible allegations are false information, clearly intended to sell the proclaimers own "on-task" work. That said, allow me to explain the nature of my work. It is the most incredibly on-task work you have ever had the fortune to encounter. It is the event horizon of on-taskness, a manifestation of work so on-task that it defies all laws of natural distraction, so much so that any off-task work that enters becomes ultimately and irreversibly destroyed. This work is so unconditionally on-task it will raze all off-task work to the greatest extent possible, wiping it clean of the face of the earth as we know it. Ultimately, this work is so on-task it could never be mistaken as a fake, even at a quick glance.</p><br><br>
