  <br>
  <h>This Work Is On Task</h><br><br>
  <p>This work is 100% fda guarenteed on task, whole grain and organic. It meets all prerequisites of being on task, and measures up to the highest standards of on-taskness. In fact, my work is so on task that if you were to compare it to the other 99.99th percentile of work, you would find my work more on task by orders of magnitude. One mole of other work does not compare to a single page of my work, which is so on task that even the worst students have trouble being off task with this work. Of course, there are those who claim that my work is not on task and is in fact off-task. Such terrible allogations are false information, clearly intended to sell the proclaimers own "on task" work. That said allow me to regail you with tales of the little known species of w ork </p><br><br>
